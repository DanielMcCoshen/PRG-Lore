Calhun is the largest surviving town in [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]] and is the trade centre of the kingdom, known as the gateway to the west. All roads to the west part of Eudin lead through Calhun. This trade superiority has caused the city's [[trade lords|The Trade Lords of Calhun]] to claim control over the town. Calhun is the location of the greatest amount of surviving tech from the [[Age of Enlightenment|The Realm of Edion]], and it is jealously guarded by the trade lords. 

Calhun is divided into two layers. On the ground sit the slums and the factories. the people here work all day for the scraps from the trade lords' tables. Floating above this is a fleet of airships that have been moored together and over the last hundred years have been built together into a floating town where the elites live only the most expensive lives, completely ignoring the workers whose labour they live off of below.
