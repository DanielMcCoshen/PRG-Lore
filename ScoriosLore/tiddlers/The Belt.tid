title: The Belt
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The belt is the wide and impassible mountain range separating all of [[Edion|The Realm of Edion]] from the land to the south. No one has attempted to pass though it and succeeded, but it is told the Elves and the other Magical Races did cross it from the south, the only race native to [[Edion|The Realm of Edion]] being humans.

It is rumoured that deep in the belt somewhere is a vast living stone [[castle|Anaranach Keep]], the place of the peace talks that ended the Age of War, but no one is quite sure where it is, and no one would be able to reach it.
