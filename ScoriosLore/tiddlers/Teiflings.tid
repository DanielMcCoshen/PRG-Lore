!Description 
Teiflings are a generally reviled ancient bloodline who decided to forcibly take back their magic. In the Age of War, the [[human|Humans]] Citizens of [[Bel-Ador|Ruins of Bel-Ador]] thought they had discovered a way to take back their ability to cast magic. No one knows what happened, or how it went wrong, but Bel-Ador was destroyed and the remaining people were left with demonic form: their skin changed to unnatural dark colours,  their eyes one solid colour, twisted horns coming from their foreheads, and long tails growing from the base of their spines.
