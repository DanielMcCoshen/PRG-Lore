title: Ruins of Bel-Ador
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ruins of what was once a great city, home to many renowned scholars, wizards, artificers, and possibly even the precursor to the [[The Great Library]]. That, however, is now far in the past. During the Age of War the humans of Bel-Ador believed they had found a way to grant themselves the ability to cast magic. Their experiments were met with success, but at an incredible cost. Most if not all of the non-humans in the city died in minutes, and the humans remaining were transformed into what are now known as [[Teiflings]].

What is left of the former city is a mess of malformed buildings, terrain and small animals, the centuries of demonic energy corrupting the surrounding land. Fear of the "Demon City" keeps most away from the South centre of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]].
