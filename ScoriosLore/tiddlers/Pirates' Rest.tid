Pirates' Rest is home to the 'scum and villainy' of the [[kingdom|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. It is a town hidden deep inside a massive sea cave on the west coast of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. The cave once held the sailing ships of many a great pirate, but as sailing ships have become defunct, the port has been retrofitted for airships. 

Pirate's rest is a chaotic and anarchic town, where might makes right. It is the best place to acquire and sell less-than-legal items and is a haven for the criminals of the land.
