title: Living Constructs
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Living Constructs, are slightly different in the world of Scorios than they are in D&D 5e. All living constructs are spirits of the dead who by means of very powerful lost magic have had their soul attached to a mechanical new body. Living Constructs can exist in this state for as long as the mechanical body is in good enough shape to do so. 

The soul encased in a living construct retains their memories of their original life, and must be wiling when attached to the new body. When resurrected, they can be resurrected as ether their mechanical body or as their original body, at the soul's choice.
